This folder contains data files with Z-score data for children and young adults from 0 to 20 years old. The data is fitted to a polynomial curve to calculate the BMI for z-scores of -2, 1 and 2 for different genders and ages.

For easier processing the two tables in zbmiage.csv were split into separate files for boys and girls. No data was changed.

The orginal data is collected from the following sources:

* https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/zscore.htm
* https://www.who.int/toolkits/child-growth-standards/standards/body-mass-index-for-age-bmi-for-age
